### Overview
These days, most corporations have their own intranet, 
which is somewhat like the internet except for the fact that itâ€™s only accessible to those within the company. 
<br> <br>
In a drive to: 
*  build a smarter, more connected workforce which can result in better collaboration,
*  ease the sharing of documents and information
*  make HR tasks easier
*  Easily manage ICT support request
*  Boost employee morale
*  Get instant access to contact details
*  Reduce the number of emails sent/received 

we opted to build our very own intranet portal.
